Images were extracted from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) dataset. The NAIP dataset consists of a total of 330,000 scenes spanning the whole of the Continental United States (CONUS). We used the uncompressed digital Ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) which are GeoTIFF images and the area corresponds to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangles. The average image tiles are ~6000 pixels in width and ~7000 pixels in height, measuring around 200 megabytes each. The entire NAIP dataset for CONUS is ~65 terabytes. The imagery is acquired at a **1-m ground sample distance (GSD)** with a horizontal accuracy that lies within six meters of photo-identifiable ground control points. The images consist of 4 bands - red, green, blue and Near Infrared (NIR). In order to maintain the high variance inherent in the entire NAIP dataset, we sample image patches from a multitude of scenes (a total of 1500 image tiles) covering different landscapes like rural areas, urban areas, densely forested, mountainous terrain, small to large water bodies, agricultural areas, etc. covering the whole state of California. An image labeling tool developed as part of this study was used to manually label uniform image patches belonging to a particular landcover class. Once labeled, 28x28 non-overlapping sliding window blocks were extracted from the uniform image patch and saved to the dataset with the corresponding label. We chose 28x28 as the window size to maintain a significantly bigger context, and at the same time not to make it as big as to drop the relative statistical properties of the target class conditional distributions within the contextual window. Care was taken to avoid interclass overlaps within a selected and labeled image patch.
The datasets are encoded as MATLAB .mat files that can be read using the standard load command in MATLAB. Each sample image is **28x28** pixels and consists of **4 bands - red, green, blue and near infrared**. The training and test labels are 1x4 and 1x6 vectors for SAT-4 and SAT-6 respectively having a single 1 indexing a particular class from 0 through 4 or 6 and 0 values at all other indices.

![](https://captain-whu.github.io/AID/aid-dataset.png)
AID is a new large-scale aerial image dataset, by collecting sample images from Google Earth imagery. Note that although the Google Earth images are post-processed using RGB renderings from the original optical aerial images, it has proven that there is no significant difference between the Google Earth images with the real optical aerial images even in the pixel-level land use/cover mapping. Thus, the Google Earth images can also be used as aerial images for evaluating scene classification algorithms. 
The new dataset is made up of the following **30 aerial scene types**: <font color=red>Aairport, bare land, baseball field, beach, bridge, center, church, commercial, dense residential, desert, farmland, forest, industrial, meadow, medium residential, mountain, park, parking, playground, pond, port, railway station, resort, river, school, sparse residential, square, stadium, storage tanks and viaduct</font>. All the images are labelled by the specialists in the field of remote sensing image interpretation, and some samples of each class are shown in Fig. In all, the AID dataset has a number of **10000 images** within 30 classes.

Considering the different image size requirements of the DCNN, construct **two datasets** of **256 × 256** and **128 × 128** pixel sizes (**RSI-CB256** and **RSI-CB128**, respectively) with **0.3–3-m spatial resolutions**. The former contains **35 categories** and **more than 24,000 images**. The latter contains **45 categories** and **more than 36,000 images**. We establish a strict object category system according to the national standard of land-use classification in China and the hierarchical grading mechanism of ImageNet. The six categories are agricultural land, construction land and facilities, transportation and facilities, water and water conservancy facilities, woodland, and other land.

The BigEarthNet is a new large-scale Sentinel-2 benchmark archive, consisting of 590,326 Sentinel-2 image patches. To construct the BigEarthNet, 125 Sentinel-2 tiles acquired between June 2017 and May 2018 over the 10 countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Kosovo, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Serbia, Switzerland) of Europe were initially selected. All the tiles were atmospherically corrected by the Sentinel-2 Level 2A product generation and formatting tool (sen2cor). Then, they were divided into 590,326 non-overlapping image patches. Each image patch was annotated by the multiple land-cover classes (i.e., multi-labels) that were provided from the CORINE Land Cover database of the year 2018 (CLC 2018).

## 3.3. Vehicle Detection in Aerial Imagery (VEDAI)

https://downloads.greyc.fr/vedai/  
VEDAI is a dataset for Vehicle Detection in Aerial Imagery, provided as a tool to benchmark automatic target recognition algorithms in unconstrained environments. The vehicles contained in the database, in addition of being small, exhibit different variabilities such as multiple orientations, lighting/shadowing changes, specularities or occlusions. Furthermore, each image is available in several spectral bands and resolutions. A precise experimental protocol is also given, ensuring that the experimental results obtained by different people can be properly reproduced and compared. We also give the performance of some baseline algorithms on this dataset, for different settings of these algorithms, to illustrate the difficulties of the task and provide baseline comparisons.

xView is one of the largest publicly available sets of overhead imagery. It contains images from complex scenes around the world, annotated with **more than one million bounding boxes** representing a diverse range of **60 object classes**. Compared to other overhead imagery datasets, xView images are high-resolution, multi-spectral, and labeled with a greater variety of objects.

Given a high-resolution satellite image, the Challenge task is to predict a bounding box for each object in the image. The DIUx xView Challenge is focused on accelerating progress in four computer vision frontiers: Reduce minimum resolution for detection; Improve learning efficiency; Enable discovery of more object classes; Improve detection of fine-grained classes.

The DIUx xView Challenge follows in the footsteps of Challenges such as Common Objects in Context (COCO) and seeks to build off SpaceNet and Functional Map of the World (FMoW) to apply computer vision to the growing amount of available imagery from space so that we can understand the visual world in new ways and address a range of important applications.

RarePlanes examines the difference between simulated and synthetic data of computer vision algorithms to detect and classify types of aircraft models in satellite imagery.

RarePlanes is both a machine learning dataset and research study that examines the value of synthetic data to aid computer vision algorithms in their ability to automatically detect aircraft and their attributes in satellite imagery.  CosmiQ curated a dataset of **~600 WorldView-3 satellite images** spanning over **200 locations** in **31 countries**. It includes **~30,000 manually annotated aircraft** and **9 fine grain attributes** including: **aircraft length, wingspan, wing-shape, wing-position, propulsion, number of engines, number of tail-fins, and aircrafts role**. The accompanying synthetic dataset is generated via IQT portfolio company AI.Reverie’s simulation platform and features over **46,000 simulated satellite images** with **~300,000 airplane annotations**.

The experiments in RarePlanes will address three key areas:

1. The performance tradeoffs of computer vision algorithms for detection and classification of aircraft type / model using blends of synthetic and real training data.
2. The performance tradeoffs of computer vision algorithms for identification of rare aircraft that are infrequently observed in satellite imagery using blends of synthetic and real training data.
3. The value of weakly supervised annotations for detection unique aircraft attributes.

The "Zurich Summer v1.0" dataset is a collection of **20 chips (crops)**, taken from a QuickBird acquisition of the city of Zurich (Switzerland) in August 2002. QuickBird images are composed by 4 channels (NIR-R-G-B) and were pansharpened to the PAN resolution of about **0.62 cm GSD**. We manually annotated **8** different urban and periurban classes : <font color=red>Roads, Buildings, Trees, Grass, Bare Soil, Water, Railways and Swimming pools</font>. The cumulative number of class samples is highly unbalanced, to reflect real world situations. Note that annotations are not perfect, are not ultradense (not every pixel is annotated) and there might be some errors as well. We performed annotations by jointly selecting superpixels (SLIC) and drawing (freehand) over regions which we could confidently assign an object class.

To this end we provide two state-of-the-art airborne image datasets, consisting of very high resolution **true ortho photo (TOP)** tiles and corresponding **digital surface models (DSMs)** derived from dense image matching techniques. Both areas cover urban scenes. While **Vaihingen** is a relatively small village with many detached buildings and small multi story buildings, **Potsdam** shows a typical historic city with large building blocks, narrow streets and dense settlement structure.

Each dataset has been classified manually into **six most common land cover classes**. We provide the classification data (label images) for approximately half of the images, while the ground truth of the remaining scenes will remain unreleased and stays with the benchmark test organizers to be used for evaluation of submitted results. Participants shall use all data with ground truth for training or internal evaluation of their method.

**Six** categories/classes have been defined:

- **Impervious surfaces** (RGB: 255, 255, 255)
- **Building** (RGB: 0, 0, 255)
- **Low vegetation** (RGB: 0, 255, 255)
- **Tree** (RGB: 0, 255, 0)
- **Car** (RGB: 255, 255, 0)
- **Clutter/background** (RGB: 255, 0, 0)

**The clutter/background class includes water bodies (present in two images with part of a river) and other objects that look very different from everything else (e.g., containers, tennis courts, swimming pools) and that are usually not of interest in semantic object classification in urban scenes, however note that participants must submit labels for all classes (including the clutter/background class).** For instance, it is not possible to submit only classification results for the category building.

## 4.3. 2017 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest

http://dase.ticinumaerospace.com/index.php
![](http://www.grss-ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/banner.png)
The 2017 Data Fusion Contest will consist in a classification benchmark. The task to perform is classification of land use (more precisely, Local Climate Zones, LCZ, Stewart and Oke, 2012) in various urban environments. Several cities have been selected to test the ability of LCZ prediction at generalizing all over the world. Input data are multi-temporal, multi-source and multi-modal (image and semantic layers).

Local climate zones are a generic, climate-based typology of urban and natural landscapes, which delivers information on basic physical properties of an area that can be used by land use planners or climate modelers. LCZ are used as first order discretization of urban areas by the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools initiative, which aims to collect, store and disseminate data on the form and function of cities around the world.

![](https://i.imgur.com/70AzK8b.png)
The LCZ classes in this study correspond to those of [Stewart & Oke, 2012]:

10 urban LCZs corresponding to various built types:

- Compact high-rise (class code in the ground truth: 1);
- Compact midrise (class code in the ground truth: 2);
- Compact low-rise (class code in the ground truth: 3);
- Open high-rise (class code in the ground truth: 4);
- Open midrise (class code in the ground truth: 5);
- Open low-rise (class code in the ground truth: 6);
- Lightweight low-rise (class code in the ground truth: 7);
- Large low-rise (class code in the ground truth: 8);
- Sparsely built (class code in the ground truth: 9);
- Heavy industry (class code in the ground truth: 10).

7 rural LCZs corresponding to various land cover types:

- Dense trees (class code in the ground truth: 11);
- Scattered trees (class code in the ground truth: 12);
- Bush and scrub (class code in the ground truth: 13);
- Low plants (class code in the ground truth: 14);
- Bare rock or paved (class code in the ground truth: 15);
- Bare soil or sand (class code in the ground truth: 16);
- Water (class code in the ground truth: 17).

The contest aims to promote innovation in **classification algorithms**, as well as to provide objective and fair comparisons among methods. Ranking is based on quantitative accuracy parameters computed with respect to undisclosed test samples from cities unseen during training. Participants will be given a limited time to submit their classification maps after the competition is started. The contest will consist of two steps:

- **Step 1 – training: Participants are provided with five training cities (Berlin, Rome, Paris, Sao Paulo, Hong Kong), including ground truth to train their algorithms.**

- **Step 2 – testing on new cities: Participants will receive the data of the test cities and will submit their classification maps by three weeks from the release of this second part of the data set. In parallel, they will submit a short description of the approach used. After evaluation of the results, 4 winners will be announced.**

**The Data:**

- **Landsat data**, in the form of images with **8 multispectral bands** (i.e. visible, short and long infrared wavelengths) resampled at **100m resolution** (courtesy of the U.S. Geological Survey);
- **Sentinel2** images, with **9 multispectral bands** (i.e. visible, vegetation red edges and short infrared wavelengths) resampled at **100m resolution** (Contains modified Copernicus Data 2016); participants are encouraged to use the full resolution data, for which a direct link is provided in the data package.
- **Ancillary data**: **Open Street Map (OSM)** layers with land use information: building, natural, roads and land-use areas. We also provide **rasterized versions of OSM layers at 20m resolution** for building and land-use areas, superimposable with the satellite images.
- Moreover, for the training cities only, we also provide **ground-truth of the various LCZ classes on several areas of the city** (defined as polygons using the class codes above). They are provided as raster layers at 100m resolution, superimposable to the satellite images. The ground-truth for the test set will remain undisclosed and will be used for evaluation of the results.

The 2018 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest, organized by the Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical Committee, aims to promote progress on fusion and analysis methodologies for multi-source remote sensing data.

The 2018 Data Fusion Contest consists of a classification benchmark. The task to be performed is urban land use and land cover classification. 

To test their synergy as well as individual potential for urban land use and land cover classification, classification results can be submitted to three parallel and independent competitions:

- **Data Fusion Classification Challenge** (use of at least two data sets)
- **Multispectral LiDAR Classification Challenge**
- **Hyperspectral Classification Challenge**

**The Data:**
We provide (Acquired by the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping, NCALM): The data were acquired by NCALM on February 16, 2017 between 16:31 and 18:18 GMT. Sensors used in this campaign include an Optech Titam MW (14SEN/CON340) with integrated camera (a LIDAR sensor operating at three different laser wavelengths), a DiMAC ULTRALIGHT+ (a very high resolution color imager) with a 70 mm focal length, and an ITRES CASI 1500 (a hyperspectral imager).

- **Multispectral-LiDAR point cloud data** at 1550 nm, 1064 nm, and 532 nm; **Intensity rasters** from first return per channel and **DSMs** at a **50-cm GSD**.
- **Hyperspectral data** covering a 380-1050 nm spectral range with **48 bands** at a **1-m GSD**.
- **Very high resolution RGB imagery** at a **5-cm GSD**. The image is organized into several separate tiles.

This dataset contains 38 Landsat 8 scene images and their manually extracted pixel-level ground truths for cloud detection. 38-Cloud dataset is introduced in [1], yet it is a modification of the dataset in [2].
The entire images of these scenes are cropped into multiple 384*384 patches to be proper for deep learning-based semantic segmentation algorithms. There are 8400 patches for training and 9201 patches for testing. Each patch has 4 corresponding spectral channels which are Red (band 4), Green (band 3), Blue (band 2), and Near Infrared (band 5). Unlike other computer vision images, these channels are not combined together. Instead, they are in their correspondig directories.

## 4.14 Chesapeake Land Cover

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/land-cover-mapping/

http://lila.science/datasets/chesapeakelandcover

This dataset contains high-resolution aerial imagery from the USDA NAIP program [[1](http://lila.science/datasets/chesapeakelandcover#rnaip)], high-resolution land cover labels from the Chesapeake Conservancy [[2](http://lila.science/datasets/chesapeakelandcover#rcc)], low-resolution land cover labels from the USGS NLCD 2011 dataset [[3](http://lila.science/datasets/chesapeakelandcover#rnlcd)], low-resolution multi-spectral imagery from Landsat 8 [[4](http://lila.science/datasets/chesapeakelandcover#rlandsat)], and high-resolution building footprint masks from Microsoft Bing [[5](http://lila.science/datasets/chesapeakelandcover#rbingfootprints)], formatted to accelerate machine learning research into land cover mapping. The Chesapeake Conservancy spent over 10 months and $1.3 million creating a consistent six-class land cover dataset covering the Chesapeake Bay watershed. While the purpose of the mapping effort by the Chesapeake Conservancy was to create land cover data to be used in conservation efforts, the same data can be used to train machine learning models that can be applied over even wider areas.

The organization of this dataset (detailed below) will allow users to easily test questions related to this problem of geographic generalization, i.e. how to train machine learning models that can be applied over even wider areas. For example, this dataset can be used to directly estimate how well a model trained on data from Maryland can generalize over the remainder of the Chesapeake Bay.

Python code for training and testing deep learning models (Keras/TensorFlow based) can be found in the accompanying GitHub repository:

High-Definition(HD) mapping is in many applications from autonomous driving to infrastructure monitoring, and urban management essential for the understanding of complex urban infrastructure with centimeter-level accuracy. Aerial images provide valuable information over a large area instantaneously; nevertheless, no current dataset captures the complexity of aerial scenes at the level of granularity required by real-world applications. To address this, we introduce SkyScapes, an aerial image dataset with highly-accurate, fine-grained annotations for pixel-level semantic labeling. SkyScapes provides annotations for 31 semantic categories ranging from large structures, such as buildings, roads and vegetation, to fine details, such as 12 (sub-)categories of lane markings. DLR-SkyScapes has been used and published in [1].

## 5.3. Aerial imagery object identification dataset for building and road detection, and building height estimation

url: https://figshare.com/collections/Aerial_imagery_object_identification_dataset_for_building_and_road_detection_and_building_height_estimation/3290519  
Automated object detection in high-resolution aerial imagery can provide valuable information in fields ranging from urban planning and operations to economic research, however, automating the process of analyzing aerial imagery requires training data for machine learning algorithm development. This dataset seeks to meet that need. For **25** locations across **9** U.S. cities, <font color=red>this dataset provides (1) high resolution aerial imagery; (2) annotations of over 40,000 building footprints (OSM shapefiles) as well as road polylines; and (3) topographical height data (LIDAR) </font>. This dataset can be used as ground truth to train computer vision and machine learning algorithms for object identification and analysis, in particular for **<font color=red>building detection</font>** and **<font color=red>height estimation</font>**, as well as **<font color=red>road detection</font>**.  
A complete description of the data can be found in the pdf file within the metadata for this collection, titled, “Metadata - building (area and height) and road dataset”. This data collection is organized such that there is a separate dataset in this collection for each of the **<font color=red>9</font>** cities with available data (**<font color=red>Arlington, MA; Atlanta, GA; Austin TX; Washington, DC; New Haven, CT; New York City, NY; Norfolk, VA; San Francisco, CA; Seekonk, MA</font>**). A map of these cities and example images can be found here: http://arcg.is/2afcSOk.  
Imagery data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS); building and road shapefiles are from OpenStreetMaps (OSM) (these OSM data are made available under the Open Database License: http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/); and the Lidar data are from U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS).

## 5.4. Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset

The Inria Aerial Image Labeling addresses a core topic in remote sensing: the automatic pixelwise labeling of aerial imagery (link to paper).

Dataset features:

- Coverage of 810 km² (405 km² for training and 405 km² for testing)
- Aerial orthorectified color imagery with a **spatial resolution of 0.3 m**
- Ground truth data for **two semantic classes**: building and not building (publicly disclosed only for the training subset)
- The images cover dissimilar urban settlements, ranging from densely populated areas (e.g., San Francisco’s financial district) to alpine towns (e.g,. Lienz in Austrian Tyrol).

Instead of splitting adjacent portions of the same images into the training and test subsets, different cities are included in each of the subsets. For example, images over Chicago are included in the training set (and not on the test set) and images over San Francisco are included on the test set (and not on the training set). The ultimate goal of this dataset is to assess the generalization power of the techniques: while Chicago imagery may be used for training, the system should label aerial images over other regions, with varying illumination conditions, urban landscape and time of the year.

## 5.5. The USSOCOM Urban 3D Challenge

https://www.topcoder.com/urban3d  
https://spacenetchallenge.github.io/datasets/Urban_3D_Challenge_summary.html  
https://github.com/topcoderinc/Urban3d  
This challenge published a large-scale dataset containing **2D orthrorectified RGB** and **3D Digital Surface Models** and **Digital Terrain Models** generated from commercial satellite imagery covering over 360 km of terrain and containing roughly **157,000** annotated building footprints. All imagery products are provided at **50 cm ground sample distance (GSD)**. This unique 2D/3D large scale dataset provides researchers an opportunity to utilize machine learning techniques to further improve state of the art performance.

Reliable labeling of buildings based on satellite imagery is one of the first and most challenging steps in producing accurate 3D models and maps. While automated algorithms continue to improve, significant manual effort is still necessary to ensure geospatial accuracy and acceptable quality. Improved automation is required to enable more rapid response to major world events such as humanitarian and disaster response. 3D height data can help improve automated building labeling performance, and capabilities for providing this data on a global scale are now emerging. In this challenge, we ask solvers to use satellite imagery and newly available 3D height data products to improve upon the state of the art for automated building detection and labeling.

USSOCOM is seeking an algorithm that provides reliable, automatic labeling of buildings based solely on orthorectified color satellite imagery and 3D height data.

Modeling population dynamics is of great importance for disaster response and recovery, and detection of buildings and urban areas are key to achieve so. We would like to pose the challenge of automatically detecting buildings from satellite images. This problem is formulated as a binary segmentation problem to localize all building polygons in each area. The evaluation will be based on the overlap of detected polygons with the ground truth.

## 5.8. WHU Building Dataset

http://study.rsgis.whu.edu.cn/pages/download/
This dataset consists of an aerial dataset and a satellite dataset.

1、    **Aerial imagery dataset**  
The original aerial data comes from the New Zealand Land Information Services website. We manually edited Christchurch's building vector data, with about 22,000 independent buildings. The original ground resolution of the images is 0.075m.

we provide manually edited shapefile corresponds to the whole area.

We also down-sampled the most parts of aerial images (including 18,7000 buildings) to 0.3m ground resolution, and cropped them into 8,189 tiles with 512×512 pixels. The shapefile is also rasterized. The ready-to-use samples are divided into three parts: a training set (130,500 buildings), a validation set (14,500 buildings) and a test set (42,000 buildings).

Training area:4736 tiles, Evaluation area: 1036 tiles, Test area: 2416 tiles
![](http://study.rsgis.whu.edu.cn/pages/download/instruction.files/image001.jpg)

2、 **Satellite dataset I (global cities)**  
One of them is collected from cities over the world and from various remote sensing resources including QuickBird, Worldview series, IKONOS, ZY-3, etc. We manually delineated all the buildings. It contains 204 images (512 × 512 tiles with resolutions varying from 0.3 m to 2.5 m). Besides the differences in satellite sensors, the variations in atmospheric conditions, panchromatic and multispectral fusion algorithms, atmospheric and radiometric corrections and season made the samples suitable yet challenging for testing robustness of building extraction algorithms.
![](http://study.rsgis.whu.edu.cn/pages/download/instruction.files/image002.jpg)

3、 **Satellite dataset Ⅱ (East Asia)**  
The other satellite building sub-dataset consists of 6 neighboring satellite images covering 550 km2 on East Asia with 2.7 m ground resolution. This test area is mainly designed to evaluate and to develop the generalization ability of a deep learning method on different data sources but with similar building styles in the same geographical area. The vector building map is also fully manually delineated in ArcGIS software and contains 29085 buildings. The whole image is seamlessly cropped into 17388 512×512 tiles for convenient training and testing with the same processing as in our aerial dataset. Among them 21556 buildings (13662 tiles) are separated for training and the rest 7529 buildings (3726 tiles) are used for testing.

Training area: 13662 tiles
Test area: 3726 tiles

4、 **Building change detection dataset**  
Our dataset covers an area where a 6.3-magnitude earthquake has occurred in February 2011 and rebuilt in the following years. This dataset consists of aerial images obtained in April 2012 that contains 12796 buildings in 20.5 km2 (16077 buildings in the same area in 2016 dataset). By manually selecting 30 GCPs on ground surface, the sub-dataset was geo-rectified to the aerial dataset with 1.6-pixel accuracy. This sub-dataset and the corresponding images from the original dataset are now openly provided along with building vector and raster maps.

## 5.9. AIRS (Aerial Imagery for Roof Segmentation)

https://www.airs-dataset.com/  
AIRS (Aerial Imagery for Roof Segmentation) is a public dataset that aims at benchmarking the algorithms of roof segmentation from very-high-resolution aerial imagery. The main features of AIRS can be summarized as:

- 457km2 coverage of orthorectified aerial images with over 220,000 buildings
- Very high spatial resolution of imagery (0.075m)
- Refined ground truths that strictly align with roof outlines

AIRS dataset covers almost the full area of Christchurch, the largest city in the South Island of New Zealand. The photography was taken during the flying seasons of 2015 and 2016, and the supplied images are ortho-rectified DOMs with RGB channels and 7.5cm resolution in projection of New Zealand Transverse Mercator. There are 226,342 labeled buildings within the whole area for experiment. To eliminate the impact of relief displacement, the ground truths for buildings are carefully refined to align with their roofs. Therefore, the segmentation task posed for AIRS contains two semantic classes: roof and non-roof pixels.

https://spacenetchallenge.github.io/datasets/spacenet-OffNadir-summary.html  

### 5.11.1. Objective

Your task will be to extract building footprints from increasingly off-nadir satellite images. The polygons you create will be compared to ground truth, and the quality of the solutions will be measured using the SpaceNet metric.

### 5.11.2. Input Files

This dataset contains 27 8-Band WorldView-2 images taken over Atlanta, GA on December 22nd, 2009. They range in off-nadir angle from 7 degrees to 54 degrees.
For the competition, the 27 images are broken into 3 segments based on their off-nadir angle:

- Nadir: 0-25 degrees
- Off-nadir: 26 degrees - 40 degrees
- Very Off-nadir 40-55 degrees

The entire set of images is tiled into 450m x 450m tiles.

The training data has 27 folders. “Atlanta_nadir{Off-Nadir Angle}_catid_{CatalogID}”

Each Collection folder than has 3 types of images are available for the target areas:

1. PAN: panchromatic (single channel, 16-bit grayscale, ~50 cm resolution)
2. MUL: 8-band multi-channel (8*16-bit, ~2m resolution). This is the equivalent of the 8-band images from the first and second competition.
3. PanSharpen: pan-sharpened version of Red-Green-Blue+NIR1 bands from the multispectral product (4 channels, 3*16-bit, ~50 cm resolution). This is formed by using the PAN image to interpolate 4 bands of the MUL dataset to increase the resolution of the Red, Green and Blue bands.

## 10.1. Vision Meets Drones: A Challenge (ECCV 2018 workshops)

http://aiskyeye.com/  
The VisDrone2018 dataset is collected by the AISKYEYE team at Lab of Machine Learning and Data Mining , Tianjin University, China. The benchmark dataset consists of 263 video clips formed by 179,264 frames and 10,209 static images, captured by various drone-mounted cameras, covering a wide range of aspects including location (taken from 14 different cities separated by thousands of kilometers in China), environment (urban and country), objects (pedestrian, vehicles, bicycles, etc.), and density (sparse and crowded scenes). Note that, the dataset was collected using various drone platforms (i.e., drones with different models), in different scenarios, and under various weather and lighting conditions. These frames are manually annotated with more than 2.5 million bounding boxes of targets of frequent interests, such as pedestrians, cars, bicycles, and tricycles. Some important attributes including scene visibility, object class and occlusion, are also provided for better data utilization.

four tasks: 

- (1) Task 1: object detection in images challenge. The task aims to detect objects of predefined categories (e.g., cars and pedestrians) from individual images taken from drones. 
- (2) Task 2: object detection in videos challenge. The task is similar to Task 1, except that objects are required to be detected from videos.
- (3) Task 3: single-object tracking challenge. The task aims to estimate the state of a target, indicated in the first frame, in the subsequent video frames.
- (4) Task 4: multi-object tracking challenge. The task aims to recover the trajectories of objects with (Task 4B) or without (Task 4A) the detection results in each video frame.

## 10.2. The Highway Drone Dataset

https://www.highd-dataset.com/  
The highD dataset is a new dataset of naturalistic vehicle trajectories recorded on German highways. Using a drone, typical limitations of established traffic data collection methods such as occlusions are overcome by the aerial perspective. Traffic was recorded at six different locations and includes more than 110 000 vehicles. Each vehicle's trajectory, including vehicle type, size and manoeuvres, is automatically extracted. Using state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, the positioning error is typically less than ten centimeters. Although the dataset was created for the safety validation of highly automated vehicles, it is also suitable for many other tasks such as the analysis of traffic patterns or the parameterization of driver models.

## 12.7 DublinCity

https://v-sense.scss.tcd.ie/DublinCity/

Urban Modelling Group at University College Dublin (UCD) captured major area of Dublin city centre (i.e. around 5.6 km^2 including partially covered areas) was scanned via an ALS device which was carried out by helicopter in 2015. However, the actual focused area was around 2 km^2 which contains the most densest LiDAR point cloud and imagery dataset. The flight altitude was mostly around 300m and the total journey was performed in 41 flight path strips.

Herein, around 260 million points (out of 1.4 billion) are labelled (figure 1). The selected area is within the most densely sampled part of the point cloud (i.e. 250 to 348 points/m^2) with full coverage by aerial images. This area (i.e. inside the red boxes) includes diverse types of historic and modern urban elements. Types of buildings include offices, shops, libraries, and residential houses. Those buildings are in the form of detached, semi-detached and terraced houses and belong to different eras (e.g. from 17th century rubrics building to the 21st century George’s Quay complex as a modern structure).

The result of the dataset and its applications are accepted and will be published at [**30th British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC)**](https://bmvc2019.org/) on 9th until 12th of September 2019.

https://github.com/fmow  
Intelligence analysts, policy makers, and first responders around the world rely on geospatial land use data to inform crucial decisions about global defense and humanitarian activities. Historically, analysts have manually identified and classified geospatial information by comparing and analyzing satellite images, but that process is time consuming and insufficient to support disaster response. The fMoW Challenge sought to foster breakthroughs in the automated analysis of overhead imagery by harnessing the collective power of the global data science and machine learning communities; empowering stakeholders to bolster their capabilities through computer vision automation. The challenge published one of the largest publicly available satellite-image datasets to date, with more than one million points of interest from around the world. The dataset also contains other elements such as temporal views, multispectral imagery, and satellite-specific metadata that researchers can exploit to build novel algorithms capable of classifying facility, building, and land use.
